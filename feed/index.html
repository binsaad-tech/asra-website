										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: left;">Rukmini Honawar<br />
Founder<br />
Runah Salon</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the year 2004, when I decided to open a store at Phoenix Mall with my Runah Salon brand, I was quite anxious as it was going to be a big move for me and my business. Everything depended upon how well I projected my new salon<br />
across to the customers in this new upmarket surrounding, manage my finances in a prudent manner and at the same time, complete the renovation in a given time frame. This called for very detailed planning and execution exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Today, I can say with great pride and conviction that I was very fortunate to have associated myself with Zubin and Krupa of ZZ Architects who not only fulfilled my requirements to the fullest but also managed to complete the job well before the promised deadline! I was pleasantly surprised to have my first up market swanky salon in the prestigious Phoenix Mall, at the promised cost,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">delivered on time!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I must mention here that my experience was enlightening and hassle free. In fact, the journey was very pleasant and cordial.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">ZUBIN AND KRUPA WERE BOTH VERY APPROACHABLE AND PATIENT WITH MY QUERIES AND HAD OPTIONS FOR EVERY NEED OF MINE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wish them all the very best and do well, they will!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: left;">Rwandan Ajay Agrawal<br />
Private Client</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Working with Zubin and Krupa was a wonderful experience. They had me involved in everything and ensured that I was satisfied at each level. With them, it has been easy to take a step back and relax all the while, knowing that the<br />
details in my home will be comfortable, functional and always beautiful. In addition to their design talent, Zubin and Krupa managed to coordinate the efforts so that the project kept moving in a timely fashion. The spaces they<br />
created are our &#8211; me and my husband’s favourite rooms.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Zubin and Krupa helped us create the home that we had always dreamed of. From the very beginning of the home design process, their team has been instrumental in creating a period home that required a special, expert touch to maintain the family-style, warm and comfort in very large space.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF PERIOD FURNITURE AND DECORATIVE STYLES, AND THEIR EXCELLENT RESOURCES FOR FURNITURE, FABRICS, TRIMS AND FIXTURES CAME TOGETHER TO GIVE US JUST THE LOOK WE DESERVED.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">With such a project, it was essential to maintain control of a high volume of details and specifics while moving the project forward. Their strong organizational skills started us off with detailed furniture layouts and followed through to the details of specific fabrics and trims.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Their ability to adapt to their client’s needs is remarkable, as is their ability to work within budgetary constraints. They have proven their leadership and ability by consistently providing great solutions in the design of our home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are a joy to work with and we would welcome the opportunity to work with them in the future. Zubin and Krupa have converted the four walls of our house into a beautiful home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="text-align: left;">Gulshan Vijan<br />
CMD<br />
Astavinayak Cranes and Infrastructure</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have great pleasure in congratulating ZZ Architects for their boundless achievements and continuous endurance in accomplishing success.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">ZZ Architects have been associated with our family for the past 8 years and have delivered well through 3 projects.<br />
In the process of giving us our dream residence, a duplex in Juhu, Krupa and Zubin have taken up this new project on a personal level. Their excellent planning and design abilities have given us an insight into the vastness of their<br />
creativity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They proposed designs for our residences that we would have never imagined to be possible. ZZ Architects not only gave us a variety of options, but also took our inputs and based the entire concept on our family’s requirements. Their eye for detail really brought out the quality and the niche look even in the simplest of things. The entire team was very cooperative and flexible with any changes in decisions or designs. Sometimes, they efficiently created different design options on the spot and displayed them for us to choose from. The ZZA Team showed us complete walkthroughs of the entire house before putting the design plan into action.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">THEY OFFERED US A VARIETY OF FURNITURE OPTIONS FROM ITALIAN AND OTHER EUROPEAN MANUFACTURERS, LIGHTING SYSTEMS FROM GERMANY, VARIOUS ITALIAN MARBLES, BATHROOM FITTINGS FROM GERMANY, ITALY AND FRANCE, AMONGST OTHERS.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">ZZA has skillfully been able to create portfolio of outstanding and diverse work ranging from residences to commercial spaces, villas and bungalows, buildings and many more. The list just keeps going on and on.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Their experience and creativity is commendable and their work is undoubtedly impressive. We can keep complimenting they service and delivery of work and it would still not be enough. I wish they reach the greatest of heights possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Cheers to ZZ Architects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal blessing from Mr. Gulshan Vijan &#8211; “ Krupa, Zubin, and the entire ZZ Team, may you all rise like the Sun that never sets, and shone brighter than any other star!”</p>

Managing Director<br />
Vedanta Dyestuffs</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">I HAVE WORKED WITH MANY ARCHITECTS AND INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTANTS OVER THE YEARS</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">and I would undoubtedly rank ZZA as one of the most insightful and diligent teams with whom I have partnered on multiple projects. Zubin and Krupa have done an excellent job to translate their ethos into the fabric of the company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I believe their success and recognition from peers is a testimony of their passion and uncompromising approach towards architecture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Over the years, my interaction with Zubin has transformed from being a professional acquaintance into a friend. I place a high value on his professional opinions and inputs while making my decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Zubin and Krupa are articulate and sensitive individuals whose superlative values underpin their approach to design. I’d definitely recommend ZZA to anyone who wants their space to be a reflection of their style and imagination.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I wish Zubin, Krupa and the entire team of ZZA many more successes in the future years</p>
